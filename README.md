# Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM)

<img src="Installer/res/haxm_logo.ico" height="176px" align="right">

HAXM is a cross-platform hardware-assisted virtualization engine (hypervisor),
widely used as an accelerator for [Android Emulator][android-studio] and
[QEMU][qemu]. It has always supported running on Windows and macOS, and has been
ported to other host operating systems as well, such as Linux and NetBSD.

HAXM runs as a kernel-mode driver on the host operating system, and provides a
KVM-like interface to user space, thereby enabling applications like QEMU to
utilize the hardware virtualization capabilities built into modern Intel CPUs,
namely [Intel Virtualization Technology][intel-vt].

## Downloads
The latest HAXM release for Windows and macOS hosts are available
[here][github-haxm-releases].

## Contributing
Detailed instructions for building and testing HAXM can be found at:
* [Manual for Linux](docs/manual-linux.md)
* [Manual for macOS](docs/manual-macos.md)
* [Manual for Windows](docs/manual-windows.md)

If you would like to contribute a patch to the code base, please also read
[these guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Reporting an Issue
You are welcome to file a [GitHub issue][github-haxm-issues] if you discover a
general HAXM bug or have a feature request.

However, please do not use the GitHub issue tracker to report security
vulnerabilities. If you have information about a security issue or vulnerability
with HAXM, please send an email to [secure@intel.com][intel-security-email], and
use the PGP key located at https://www.intel.com/security to encrypt any
sensitive information.
